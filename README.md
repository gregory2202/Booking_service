## Admin Panel

Administrators and developers can interact with the database through a convenient web interface accessible at `/admin`
after the server is launched.

## Documentation

Users and developers can access the complete API documentation available at `/docs` after the server startup.

## ðŸš€ Application Launch

The uvicorn web server is used to run FastAPI. The launch command is as follows:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```  

This command should be run from the project's root directory.

### Celery & Flower

To launch Celery, use the command:

```
celery --app=app.tasks.celery_settings:app_celery worker -l INFO -P solo
```

Note that `-P solo` is used only on Windows as Celery has issues operating on Windows.  
For launching Flower, use:

```
celery --app=app.tasks.celery_settings:app_celery flower
``` 

### Dockerfile

To run the web server (FastAPI) inside a container, uncomment the code inside the Dockerfile and have a PostgreSQL
instance running on your computer. To run the Dockerfile, use:

```
docker build .
```  

This command is also run from the root directory where the Dockerfile is located.

### Docker Compose

To launch all services (DB, Redis, web server (FastAPI), Celery, Flower, Grafana, Prometheus), use the
docker-compose.yml file and commands:

```
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

The `build` command should only be run if you have modified the Dockerfile, i.e., changed the image building logic.
